      <span class="sections"><b>Thoughts on Software Quality Assurance</b></span> üí≠
      <br />
      - Every project, every team, and every challenge teaches me
      <br />
      - something new. I've learned a lot from the people I've worked with.
      <br />
      <br />
      - I see my role as an observer and communicator, not as a gatekeeper
      <br />
      - or the 'quality police.' My job is to provide insights so the team
      <br />
      - can make informed decisions, not create roadblocks.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Don't just make sure nothing's on fire, ask why the gas line's leaking.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Don't just inspect the faucet. Inspect the plumbing.
      <br />
      <br />
      - QA isn't just about clicking through features and reporting obvious
      <br />
      - bugs. It's about digging deeper even when things seem fine, asking
      <br />
      - whether things actually make sense, catching the stuff no one else
      <br />
      - thought to look for, and not assuming what's given to you is correct.
      <br />
      <br />
      - See why <a href="/html/it-works.htm">"It works" isn't enough in QA</a>.
      <br />
      <br />
      - The foundation for quality starts upstream even before a single
      <br />
      - line of code is written. Quality issues can start way earlier in
      <br />
      - fuzzy requirements, unclear designs, unchallenged assumptions,
      <br />
      - and overlooked scenarios. Sure, testing can catch the cracks
      <br />
      - later, but it's a lot harder to fix the foundation after the
      <br />
      - house is already built. See an <a href="/html/requirement-gap.htm">example of a bug</a> caused by a
      <br />
      - missing requirement.
      <br />
      <br />
      - If QA collaborates early they can help the team spot where
      <br />
      - cracks might form before the concrete is even placed.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Tight deadlines don't help either. If teams are under chronic
      <br />
      - pressure to hit deadlines, it often leads to rushing, cutting
      <br />
      - corners, and a string of hotfixes that just patch up other
      <br />
      - hotfixes. That's when quality starts to slip, because the
      <br />
      - focus shifts from doing things right to just getting it done.
      <br />
      <br />
      - You're shaping the product with a focus on user experience and
      <br />
      - business impact. Say you're testing a new checkout flow. The goal
      <br />
      - is more sales. If the process feels cumbersome you flag it, even
      <br />
      - if there are no functional bugs, because it might cause people
      <br />
      - to abandon their cart.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Not all parts of an application are equally important or carry
      <br />
      - the same level of risk.
      <br />
      <br />
      - <span id="wont-do">Not all bugs are worth fixing</span>. In the real world, teams don't
      <br />
      - have unlimited time or dev resources to fix every bug and make
      <br />
      - everything perfect. You prioritize. Some bugs just don't matter
      <br />
      - enough to fix, and so you mark them as "won't do" and move on.
      <br />
      <br />
      - <span id="pull-requests">Look at the pull request and diff, even if you can't read the code.</span>
      <br />
      - How big of a change is it (one file or ten?), and in which areas?
      <br />
      - Check the PR convo too. If it says, ‚ÄúWait, are we sure this is the
      <br />
      - right behavior?‚Äù or ‚ÄúQuick patch before launch,‚Äù then you should
      <br />
      - probably test more thoroughly. I'm not reviewing code; I'm looking
      <br />
      - at PRs to understand scope, risk, and the story behind the change.
      <br />

      <span class="sections"><b>Thoughts on Manual Testing</b></span> üí≠
      <br />
      - I find value in exploratory testing. It's the freedom to approach
      <br />
      - testing naturally, seeing the software through the eyes of an end
      <br />
      - user. Without the confinement of scripts, it opens the door to
      <br />
      - creativity and adaptability.

      <span class="sections" id="automation-testing"><b>Thoughts on Automation Testing</b></span> üí≠
      <br />
      - Automation doesn't replace manual testing.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Not every test is a good candidate or suitable for automation.
      <br />
      <br />
      - The Automation suite can grow too big and become unmanageable.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Be prepared to deal with and troubleshoot flaky tests.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Don't forget to <span class="color-shift-usa">test your tests</span>. Make sure the assertion
      <br />
      - fails when it should and passes when it should...consistently.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Looking ahead is important. If the product roadmap says a part
      <br />
      - of our site is getting a facelift in the next couple of months,
      <br />
      - maybe we shouldn't go all-in on automation scripts just yet.
      <br />
      - The last thing we want is to spend more time maintaining
      <br />
      - automation scripts than we save by having them.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Also we need to keep in mind that automated scripts can be
      <br />
      - sensitive, behaving differently between environments. What
      <br />
      - works perfectly in your local environment, might throw a fit
      <br />
