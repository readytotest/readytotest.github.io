            - I see my role as an observer and communicator, not as the gatekeeper
            <br>
            - or ‚Äòquality police.‚Äô I provide feedback, not roadblocks. If the team
            <br>
            - wants to ship something, my job is to make them aware of potential
            <br>
            - issues, not to hold things up. This approach has helped me build
            <br>
            - strong, collaborative relationships with developers, designers, and PMs.
            <br>
            <br>
            - Quality is a team effort, not just a post-coding activity.
            <br>
            <br>
            - QA teams are there to complement and enhance quality efforts,
            <br>
            - not to replace them entirely. Developers, product managers,
            <br>
            - designers, and other stakeholders play a crucial role in maintaining
            <br>
            - quality standards throughout the development process.
            <br>
            <br>
            - It's impractical to test every possible scenario.
            <br>
            <br>
            - Additional defects found by exhaustive testing may not justify
            <br>
            - the resources invested in leaving no stone unturned.
            <br>
            <br>
            - Not all parts of an application are equally important
            <br>
            - or carry the same level of risk.
            <br>
            <br>
            - Testing should be concentrated on the areas that are most critical
            <br>
            - to the users and have the highest impact on the user experience. 
            <br>
            <br>
            - Not all bugs are worth fixing.

            <span class="sections"><b>A Holistic Approach to Quality</span></b></span>
            <br>
            My approach to quality assurance goes beyond finding bugs. I
            <br>
            look at the application as a whole, identifying gaps in requirements
            <br>
            and assessing not just functionality but the overall user experience.
            <br>
            Often, I find areas where the code meets the technical specifications,
            <br>
            but the spec itself didn't fully consider certain user perspectives or
            <br>
            scenarios. My goal is to provide feedback that aligns with real-world
            <br>
            usage, helping teams anticipate potential issues and improving the product
            <br>
            for end users. I aim for software that‚Äôs as functional as it is user-friendly.

            <br>
            thoughtful, independent work and can produce high-quality results
            <br>
            in less stressful environments. I perform best in environments
            <br>
            where I have the space to think things through and manage my tasks at
            <br>
            a steady, efficient pace. I prefer fewer meetings, minimal
            <br>
            distractions, and an asynchronous work style that allows me to focus
            <br>
            deeply and deliver quality work while still staying aligned with the
            <br>
            team. While I work best when I have time for deep focus and independent
            <br>
            tasks, I also thrive in smaller collaborative settings, such as working
            <br>
            closely with developers. I'm always ready to seek help when I hit a
            <br>
            roadblock or be there for the team when they need me.

            with vague or evolving requirements. I don't need everything spelled
            <br>
            out for me or much handholding. In fact, I actually prefer unstructured
            <br>
            environments because they give me the freedom and autonomy to figure
            <br>
            things out as I go. I trust my judgment and experience to guide me when
            <br>
            things aren‚Äôt perfectly laid out and enjoy the challenge of navigating
            <br>
            ambiguity. If something doesn‚Äôt feel right, I‚Äôll ask for clarification,
            <br>
            but I‚Äôm comfortable with taking the initiative to find solutions
            <br>
            independently.

            or hustle culture. Been there, done that. Never again.

            <span class="sections"><b>Thoughts on Agile, Scrum, Kanban</b></span> üí≠
            <br>
            Agile can be a bit confusing for me because it‚Äôs implemented differently
            <br>
            everywhere. Teams might keep the stand-ups, sprint planning, retros,
            <br>
            but the workflow often feels more like a waterfall process with
            <br>
            ceremonies.
            <br>
            <br>
            For example, when QA is only involved after development is complete, it
            <br>
            feels more like a handoff than true collaboration. Agile is meant to
            <br>
            be about working together from start to finish, not just passing tasks
            <br>
            off from one team to the next.
            <br>
            <br>
            I‚Äôve also seen story points tied to hours, with each person assigned a
            <br>
            specific number of points to complete each sprint. Story points are
            <br>
            meant to represent effort or complexity, not time. When they‚Äôre treated
            <br>
            like quotas, it puts pressure on teams to rush through tasks to hit those
            <br>
            targets, which can lead to cutting corners and unrealistic deadlines.
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            How about we just remove all these Agile ceremonies that don‚Äôt add much
            <br>
            and just call it what it really is, waterfall? Or better yet, adopt Kanban
            <br>
            and focus on keeping the work flowing, no time-boxed sprints, fewer
            <br>
            meetings, and without the pressure to meet unrelenting deadlines.
            <br>

            <br>
            <span class="sections"><b>Thoughts on Manual Testing</b></span> üí≠
            <br>
            I find value in exploratory testing. It's the freedom to approach
            <br>
            testing naturally, seeing the software through the eyes of an end
            <br>
            user. Without the confinement of scripts, it opens the door to
            <br>
            creativity and adaptability. This flexibility allows me to uncover
            <br>
            issues that might otherwise slip through the cracks. It also
            <br>
            encourages usability and UX observations that may not be considered
            <br>
            during a structured test. It's where testing transforms into an art,
            <br>
            using my curiosity, intuition, and testing instinct to uncover
            <br>
            unexpected issues.

            <span class="sections"><b>Thoughts on Automation Testing</b></span> üí≠
            <br>
            I'm all for automation, but I feel the idea of automating 
            <br>
            everything should be approached with caution.  I'm not jumping
            <br>
            on the automate everything bandwagon and recognize the pitfalls
            <br>
            of flaky tests and heavy maintenance burdens. It's not a
            <br>
            magic wand that makes manual testing disappear. There's a
            <br>
            misconception that it always saves time, but in reality, that's
            <br>
            not a guarantee. I believe in a balance between manual and
            <br>
            automated testing.
            <br>
            <br>
            - Automation doesn't eliminate the need for manual testing.
            <br>
            - Automation won't always save time over manual testing.
            <br>
            - Not every test is a good candidate or suitable for automation.
            <br>
            - Creating an automation script requires an initial time investment.
            <br>
            - Automation scripts require an ongoing time investment (maintenance).
            <br>
            - Automation suite can grow too big and become unmanageable.
            <br>
            - Be prepared to deal with and troubleshoot flaky tests.
            <br>
            - Automation often leads to unexpected challenges.
            <br> 
            <br> 
            Looking ahead is important. If the product roadmap says a part
            <br>
            of our site is getting a facelift in the next couple of months, 
            <br>
            maybe we shouldn't go all-in on automation scripts just yet. 
            <br>
            The last thing we want is to spend more time maintaining
            <br>
            automation scripts than we save by having them.
            <br>
            <br>
            Also we need to keep in mind that automated scripts can be sensitive,
            <br>
            behaving differently between environments. What works perfectly in
            <br>
            your local environment, might throw a fit in the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Actions runner</a>.
