      <span class="sections">Thoughts on Software Quality Assurance</span> üí≠
      <br />
      - I dig deep and find things. QA isn't just about clicking through
      <br />
      - features and reporting obvious bugs. It's about digging deeper
      <br />
      - even when things seem fine, asking whether things actually make
      <br />
      - sense, catching the stuff no one else thought to look for, and
      <br />
      - not assuming what's given to you is correct.
      <br />
      <br />
      - QA shouldn't only be the person who shows up after the party and
      <br />
      - says, "Hey, someone spilled wine on the couch." üç∑ QA should be
      <br />
      - the one saying, "Hey, maybe don't set the red wine next to the
      <br />
      - dance floor in the first place."
      <br />
      <br />
      <span id="weak-tests">‚úÖ Just because your manual or automated tests pass doesn't mean your</span>
      <br />
      ‚úÖ product does. It just means the code did what the tests expected.
      <br />
      ‚úÖ If the tests are weak, then those green check marks are worthless.
      <br />
      ‚úÖ It's like a car passing an inspection that never checked the brakes.
      <br />
      <br />
      - See why <a href="/html/it-works.htm">"It works" isn't enough in QA</a>.
      <br />
      <br />
      - The foundation for quality starts upstream even before a single
      <br />
      - line of code is written. Quality issues can start way earlier in
      <br />
      - fuzzy requirements, unclear designs, unchallenged assumptions,
      <br />
      - and overlooked scenarios. Sure, testing can catch the cracks
      <br />
      - later, but it's a lot harder to fix the foundation after the
      <br />
      - house is already built.
      <a href="/html/requirement-gap.htm">See an example of a bug caused by a</a>
      <br />
      - <a href="/html/requirement-gap.htm">missing requirement</a>.
      <br />
      <br />
      - You're shaping the product with a focus on user experience and
      <br />
      - business impact. Say you're testing a new checkout flow. The goal
      <br />
      - is more sales. If the process feels cumbersome you flag it, even
      <br />
      - if there are no functional bugs, because it might cause people
      <br />
      - to abandon their cart. You're not just testing the features,
      <br />
      <br />
      - Everyone misses stuff when they are too close to their own
      <br />
      - work. Devs may focus on confirming if things works, not
      <br />
      - catching where it might break. They tend to stick to happy
      <br />
      - paths, miss edge cases, and overlook UX issues. Just like
      <br />
      - like when I test my own site and only notice the typos after
      <br />
      - it's live. I went full 1990s retro with it, and yeah I know
      <br />
      - the UX is exactly as questionable as it was back then. Same
      <br />
      - goes for when devs code review my automation scripts. They
      <br />
      - catch things I miss, and I learn a lot from them.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Other teams testing, not QA: They often miss things because
      <br />
      - they're too close and lack testing skills. They often focus on
      <br />
      - what they know or care about. QA catches what they don't by
      <br />
      - thinking like real users and digging deeper.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Offshoring QA often creates a setup where people are boxed
      <br />
      - into just following instructions because they don't have the
      <br />
      - context, access, or real-time connection to contribute more.
      <br />
      <br />
      - If QA collaborates early they can help the team spot where
      <br />
      - cracks might form before the concrete is even placed.
      <br />
      <br />
      - <span id="wont-do">Not all bugs are worth fixing</span>. In the real world, teams don't
      <br />
      - have unlimited time or dev resources to fix every bug and make
      <br />
      - everything perfect. You prioritize. Some bugs just don't matter
      <br />
      - enough to fix, and so you mark them as "won't do" and move on.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Not all parts of an application are equally important or carry
      <br />
      - the same level of risk.
      <br />
      <br />
      - <span id="pull-requests">Look at the pull request and diff, even if you can't read the code.</span>
      <br />
      - How big of a change is it (one file or ten?), and in which areas?
      <br />
      - Check the PR convo too. If it says, ‚ÄúWait, are we sure this is the
      <br />
      - right behavior?‚Äù or ‚ÄúQuick patch before launch,‚Äù then you should
      <br />
      - probably test more thoroughly. I'm not reviewing code; I'm looking
      <br />
      - at PRs to understand scope, risk, and the story behind the change.
      <br />
      <br />

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
        >Goodhart's Law</a
      >: "When a measure
      <br />
      - becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." Just look at
      <br />
      - the

        >VW emissions scandal</a
      >
      for a real-world example of what
      <br />
      - happens when metrics become the goal instead of real quality.
      <br />
      - You may end up with a team more focused on protecting their
      <br />
      - metrics than actually improving software quality.
      <br />
      <br />
      - <span id="tight-deadlines">Tight deadlines</span> don't help either. If teams are under chronic
      <br />
      - pressure to hit deadlines, it often leads to rushing, cutting
      <br />
      - corners, and a string of hotfixes that just patch up other
      <br />
      - hotfixes. That's when quality starts to slip, because the
      <br />
      - focus shifts from doing things right to just getting it done.

      <span class="sections">Thoughts on Manual Testing</span> üí≠
      <br />
      - I'm an exploratory tester who first started in UX research
      <br />
      - and I've seen first hand that users don't follow expected
      <br />
      - behaviors or assumptions about workflows. You know those
      <br />
      - preconceived ideas or fixed paths people expect users to
      <br />
      - take, like assuming everyone uses the app the same way or
      <br />
      - follows the ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù perfectly. Real users often do
      <br />
      - things differently or unexpectedly. I may jot down some
      <br />
      - areas or scenarios that I want to explore, but I don't follow
      <br />
      - a strict script.
      <br />
      <br />
      - If written test cases are needed, that time's better spent
      <br />
      - writing out the documentation as code in an automation script.
      <br />
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
      <br />
      <span class="sections" id="automation-testing">Thoughts on Automation Testing</span> üí≠
      <br />
      - Automation is a tool; it's not the whole toolkit. It doesn't
      <br />
      - replace manual testing. Manual testing is needed for exploring
      <br />
      - new features, identifying edge cases, and understanding the
      <br />
      - user experience. Automation can't replace human intuition or
      <br />
      - creativity, and it will miss anything that requires thinking
      <br />
      - outside the script.
      <br />
      <br />
      üöô Automation passed, experience failed. Even if the brakes
      <br />
      üöô work, it doesn't mean the car is comfortable, the controls
      <br />
      üöô are intuitive, and the dashboard is easy to read. Automation
      <br />
      üöô won't uncover any of this. It just checks if the car moves.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Not every test is a good candidate or suitable for automation.
      <br />
      - Some tests are too complex, too flaky, or depend on things
      <br />
      - outside your control.
      <br />
      <br />
      - The automation suite can grow too big and become unmanageable.
      <br />
      - Focus on the critical paths and high-risk areas of the application.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Don't forget to <span class="color-shift-usa">test your tests</span>. You want to avoid the flaky ones.
      <br />
      - You'll have flaky tests no matter what, like assertions failing due
      <br />
      - due to time zones or environment quirks, so be ready when the devs
      <br />
      - say, ‚ÄúHey, your test broke my PR for no reason.‚Äù
      <br />
      <br />
      - And brittle tests? They break with small changes like targeting the
      <br />
      - nth element, then a front-end dev adds one above it, and boom, your
      <br />
      - test fails. Sometimes you can't avoid those selectors because of how
      <br />
      - the code's built, and if you can't add a custom HTML attribute like
      <br />
      - datatest-id, you'll just learn to live with it.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Looking ahead is important. If the product roadmap says a part
      <br />
      - of our site is getting a facelift in the next couple of months,
      <br />
      - maybe we shouldn't go all-in on automation scripts just yet.
      <br />
      - The last thing we want is to spend more time maintaining
      <br />
      - automation scripts than we save by having them.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Also we need to keep in mind that automated scripts can be
      <br />
      - sensitive, behaving differently between environments. What
      <br />
      - works perfectly in your local environment, might throw a fit
      <br />
      - in the
