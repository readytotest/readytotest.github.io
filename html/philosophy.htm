      <br />
      - Every project, every team, and every challenge teaches me
      <br />
      - something new. I've learned a lot from the people I've worked with.
      <br />
      <br />
      - I see my role as an observer and communicator, not as a gatekeeper
      <br />
      - or the 'quality police.' My job is to provide insights so the team
      <br />
      - can make informed decisions, not create roadblocks.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Don't just inspect the faucet. Inspect the plumbing.
      <br />
      - QA isn't just about clicking through features and reporting bugs.
      <br />
      - It's about digging deeper even when things seem fine on the surface
      <br />
      <br />
      - Quality issues can begin long before the first line of code is
      <br />
      - written. They can come from fuzzy requirements, unclear designs,
      <br />
      - unchallenged assumptions, and overlooked scenarios. If QA
      <br />
      - collaborates with the team early on they can help the team spot
      <br />
      - where cracks might form before the concrete is even placed.
      <br />
      <br />
      - As a QA, you're not just testing what's given to you, but
      <br />
      - shaping the product with a focus on user experience and business
      <br />
      - impact.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Not all parts of an application are equally important or carry
      <br />
      - the same level of risk.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Not all bugs are worth fixing.

      <br />
      I find value in exploratory testing. It's the freedom to approach
      <br />
      testing naturally, seeing the software through the eyes of an end
      <br />
      user. Without the confinement of scripts, it opens the door to
      <br />
      creativity and adaptability. This flexibility allows me to uncover
      <br />
      issues that might otherwise slip through the cracks. It also
      <br />
      encourages usability and UX observations that may not be considered
      <br />
      during a structured test. It's where testing transforms into an art,
      <br />
      using my curiosity, intuition, and testing instinct to uncover
      <br />
      unexpected issues.

      <span class="sections" id="automation-testing"><b>Thoughts on Automation Testing</b></span> üí≠
      <br />
      I'm all for automation, but I feel the idea of automating
      <br />
      everything should be approached with caution. I'm not jumping
      <br />
      on the automate everything bandwagon and recognize the pitfalls
      <br />
      of flaky tests and heavy maintenance burdens. It's not a
      <br />
      magic wand that makes manual testing disappear. There's a
      <br />
      misconception that it always saves time, but in reality, that's
      <br />
      not a guarantee. I believe in a balance between manual and
      <br />
      automated testing.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Automation doesn't eliminate the need for manual testing.
      <br />
      - Automation won't always save time over manual testing.
      <br />
      - Not every test is a good candidate or suitable for automation.
      <br />
      - Creating an automation script requires an initial time investment.
      <br />
      - Automation scripts require an ongoing time investment (maintenance).
      <br />
      - Automation suite can grow too big and become unmanageable.
      <br />
      - Be prepared to deal with and troubleshoot flaky tests.
      <br />
      - Automation often leads to unexpected challenges.
      <br />
      <br />
      Looking ahead is important. If the product roadmap says a part
      <br />
      of our site is getting a facelift in the next couple of months,
      <br />
      maybe we shouldn't go all-in on automation scripts just yet.
      <br />
      The last thing we want is to spend more time maintaining
      <br />
      automation scripts than we save by having them.
      <br />
      <br />
      Also we need to keep in mind that automated scripts can be sensitive,
      <br />
      behaving differently between environments. What works perfectly in
      <br />
      your local environment, might throw a fit in the
