      <span class="sections"><b>Thoughts on Software Quality Assurance</b></span> üí≠
      <br />
      - Quality isn't just about passing tests. It's about building
      <br />
      - something that actually works well in the real world, for
      <br />
      - real users!
      <br />
      <br />
      - I see my role as an observer and communicator, not as a gatekeeper
      <br />
      - or the 'quality police.' My job is to provide feedback, not create
      <br />
      - roadblocks.
      <br />
      <br />
      - If the team is ready to ship something, my role is to help do it
      <br />
      - with confidence by making sure we are all aware of any potential
      <br />
      - issues.
      <br />
      <br />
      - This approach has always been about teamwork. I see QA as a
      <br />
      - partner to developers, designers, and PMs, not an adversary.
      <br />
      <br />
      - I've been lucky to work with great people throughout my QA
      <br />
      - career, and many of them became friends along the way. I'm
      <br />
      - still in touch with quite a few, which says a lot about the
      <br />
      - kind of collaboration we shared.
      <br />
      <br />
      - I've seen how impactful it is when QA is involved early,
      <br />
      - helping refine requirements, reviewing UX designs,
      <br />
      - closing gaps, and preventing issues before coding starts.
      <br />
      - It not only improves product quality but also makes
      <br />
      - collaboration smoother, reducing back-and-forth later in
      <br />
      - development. I think product and development teams benefit
      <br />
      - the most in environments where QA is part of the full process
      <br />
      - and plays a more strategic role, rather than just being a
      <br />
      - final check before release.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Quality is a <span class="color-shift-usa">team effort</span>, not just a post-coding activity.
      <br />
      <br />
      - QA teams are there to complement and enhance quality efforts,
      <br />
      - not to replace them entirely. Developers, product managers,
      <br />
      - designers, and other stakeholders play a crucial role in maintaining
      <br />
      - quality standards throughout the development process.
      <br />
      <br />
      - To me, real ownership goes beyond just finding bugs or fixing things.
      <br />
      - It's about noticing what others might miss and caring enough to point
      <br />
      - it out, whether you're in QA or any other role.
      <br />
      <br />
      - It's impractical to test every possible scenario.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Additional defects found by exhaustive testing may not justify
      <br />
      - the resources invested in leaving no stone unturned.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Not all parts of an application are equally important
      <br />
      - or carry the same level of risk.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Testing should be concentrated on the areas that are most critical
      <br />
      - to the users and have the highest impact on the user experience.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Not all bugs are worth fixing.

      <span class="sections"><b>Thoughts on Manual Testing</b></span> üí≠
      <br />
      I find value in exploratory testing. It's the freedom to approach
      <br />
      testing naturally, seeing the software through the eyes of an end
      <br />
      user. Without the confinement of scripts, it opens the door to
      <br />
      creativity and adaptability. This flexibility allows me to uncover
      <br />
      issues that might otherwise slip through the cracks. It also
      <br />
      encourages usability and UX observations that may not be considered
      <br />
      during a structured test. It's where testing transforms into an art,
      <br />
      using my curiosity, intuition, and testing instinct to uncover
      <br />
      unexpected issues.

      <span class="sections" id="automation-testing"><b>Thoughts on Automation Testing</b></span> üí≠
      <br />
      I'm all for automation, but I feel the idea of automating
      <br />
      everything should be approached with caution. I'm not jumping
      <br />
      on the automate everything bandwagon and recognize the pitfalls
      <br />
      of flaky tests and heavy maintenance burdens. It's not a
      <br />
      magic wand that makes manual testing disappear. There's a
      <br />
      misconception that it always saves time, but in reality, that's
      <br />
      not a guarantee. I believe in a balance between manual and
      <br />
      automated testing.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Automation doesn't eliminate the need for manual testing.
      <br />
      - Automation won't always save time over manual testing.
      <br />
      - Not every test is a good candidate or suitable for automation.
      <br />
      - Creating an automation script requires an initial time investment.
      <br />
      - Automation scripts require an ongoing time investment (maintenance).
      <br />
      - Automation suite can grow too big and become unmanageable.
      <br />
      - Be prepared to deal with and troubleshoot <span class="color-shift-usa">flaky tests</span>.
      <br />
      - Automation often leads to unexpected challenges.
      <br />
      <br />
      Looking ahead is important. If the product roadmap says a part
      <br />
      of our site is getting a facelift in the next couple of months,
      <br />
      maybe we shouldn't go all-in on automation scripts just yet.
      <br />
      The last thing we want is to spend more time maintaining
      <br />
      automation scripts than we save by having them.
      <br />
      <br />
      Also we need to keep in mind that automated scripts can be sensitive,
      <br />
      behaving differently between environments. What works perfectly in
      <br />
      your local environment, might throw a fit in the
