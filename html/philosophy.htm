      <span class="sections">Thoughts on Software Quality Assurance</span> üí≠
      <br />
      - QA exists to protect the business and be an advocate for the
      <br />
      - end user.
      <br />
      <br />
      - If it all ‚Äúlooks good,‚Äù that's your cue to look deeper.
      <br />
      <br />
      - QA isn't just about clicking through features and reporting
      <br />
      - obvious bugs. It's about digging deeper even when things seem
      <br />
      - fine, asking whether things actually make sense, and not
      <br />
      - assuming what's given to you is correct.
      <br />
      <br />
      - I see QA as an observer and communicator, not as a gatekeeper
      <br />
      - or the 'quality police.' My job is to provide insights so the team
      <br />
      - can make informed decisions, not create roadblocks.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Quality kicks in way before code shows up. Upstream affects
      <br />
      - downstream. Bugs don't only originate in the code. They also
      <br />
      - come from rushed choices, <a href="/html/requirement-gap.htm">fuzzy requirements</a>, and blind spots.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Testing can catch some stuff later, but it's a lot harder to fix
      <br />
      - the foundation after the house is already built.
      <br />
      <br />
      - If QA collaborates early they can help the team spot where
      <br />
      - cracks might form before the concrete is even placed.
      <br />
      <br />
      <span id="weak-tests">‚úÖ Just because your tests pass doesn't mean your</span> product does.
      <br />
      ‚úÖ It just means the code did what the tests expected. If the
      <br />
      ‚úÖ tests are weak, then those green check marks are worthless.
      <br />
      ‚úÖ It's like a car passing an inspection that never checked the
      <br />
      ‚úÖ brakes.
      <br />
      <br />
      - When you're checking your own work, you're too close to it.
      <br />
      - Everyone has blind spots.
      <br />
      <br />
      <span id="wont-do"> - Not all bugs are worth fixing</span>. In the real world, teams don't
      <br />
      - have unlimited time or dev resources to fix every bug and make
      <br />
      - everything perfect. You prioritize. Some bugs just don't matter
      <br />
      - enough to fix, and so you mark them as "won't do" and move on.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Not all parts of an application are equally important or carry
      <br />
      - the same level of risk.
      <br />
      <br />

      says: "When a measure becomes a target, it
      <br />
      - ceases to be a good measure." Look at the

      <br />
      - If metrics become the goal, you may end up with a team protecting
      <br />
      - numbers instead of actually improving software.
      <br />
      <br />
      - If a team pushes fast, takes risks, and things go sideways,

      <br />
      <span class="sections">Thoughts on Manual Testing</span> üí≠
      <br />
      - Manual testing is needed for exploring new features, identifying
      <br />
      - edge cases, and understanding the user experience.
      <br />
      <br />
      - I'm an exploratory tester who first started in UX research
      <br />
      - and I've seen first hand that users don't follow expected
      <br />
      - behaviors or assumptions about workflows. You know those
      <br />
      - preconceived ideas or fixed paths people expect users to
      <br />
      - take, like assuming everyone uses the app the same way or
      <br />
      - follows the ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù perfectly. Real users often do
      <br />
      - things differently or unexpectedly. I may jot down some
      <br />
      - areas or scenarios that I want to explore, but I don't follow
      <br />
      - a strict script.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Some people think manual testing doesn't take much skill.
      <br />
      - Sure, anyone can do it, but it's like anyone can cook a
      <br />
      - meal. It doesn't mean it's any good. Some follow the recipe
      <br />
      - without knowing why, miss the details, and forget about the
      <br />
      - user experience. That surface-level testing means the real
      <br />
      - users end up finding the frustrating bugs in production. üòÖ
      <br />
      - Really good manual testing is definitely not less valuable
      <br />
      - or easier than automation. It's just a different, creative
      <br />
      - kind of skill not everyone has.
      <br />
      <br />
      - If written test cases are needed, that time's better spent
      <br />
      - writing out the documentation as code in an automation script.
      <br />
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
      <br />
      <span class="sections" id="automation-testing">Thoughts on Automation Testing</span> üí≠
      <br />
      - Automation is a tool; it's not the whole toolkit. It doesn't
      <br />
      - replace manual testing. Automation can't replace human intuition
      <br />
      - or creativity, and it will miss anything that requires thinking
      <br />
      - outside the script.
      <br />
      <br />
      üöô Automation passed, experience failed. Even if the brakes
      <br />
      üöô work, it doesn't mean the car is comfortable, the controls
      <br />
      üöô are intuitive, and the dashboard is easy to read. Automation
      <br />
      üöô won't uncover any of this. It just checks if the car moves.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Not every test is a good candidate or suitable for automation.
      <br />
      - Some tests are too complex, too flaky, or depend on things
      <br />
      - outside your control.
      <br />
      <br />
      - The automation suite can grow too big and become unmanageable.
      <br />
      - Focus on the critical paths and high-risk areas of the application.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Don't forget to <span class="color-shift-usa">test your tests</span>. You want to avoid the flaky ones.
      <br />
      - You'll have flaky tests no matter what, like assertions failing due
      <br />
      - due to time zones or environment quirks, so be ready when the devs
      <br />
      - say, ‚ÄúHey, your test broke my PR for no reason.‚Äù
      <br />
      <br />
      - And brittle tests? They break with small changes like targeting the
      <br />
      - nth element, then a front-end dev adds one above it, and boom, your
      <br />
      - test fails. Sometimes you can't avoid those selectors because of how
      <br />
      - the code's built, and if you can't add a custom HTML attribute like
      <br />
      - datatest-id, you'll just learn to live with it.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Looking ahead is important. If the product roadmap says a part
      <br />
      - of our site is getting a facelift in the next couple of months,
      <br />
      - maybe we shouldn't go all-in on automation scripts just yet.
      <br />
      - The last thing we want is to spend more time maintaining
      <br />
      - automation scripts than we save by having them.
      <br />
      <br />
      - Also we need to keep in mind that automated scripts can be
      <br />
      - sensitive, behaving differently between environments. What
      <br />
      - works perfectly in your local environment, might throw a fit
      <br />
      - in the
