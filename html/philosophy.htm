            <br>
            - I see my role as an observer and communicator, not as the gatekeeper
            <br>
            - or 'quality police.' I provide feedback, not roadblocks. If the team
            <br>
            - wants to ship something, my job is to make them aware of potential
            <br>
            - issues, not to hold things up.
            <br>
            <br>
            - This approach has helped me build stong collaborative relationships
            <br>
            with developers, designers, and PMs.
            <br>
            <br>
            - Quality is a team effort, not just a post-coding activity.
            <br>
            <br>
            - QA teams are there to complement and enhance quality efforts,
            <br>
            - not to replace them entirely. Developers, product managers,
            <br>
            - designers, and other stakeholders play a crucial role in maintaining
            <br>
            - quality standards throughout the development process.
            <br>
            <br>
            - It's impractical to test every possible scenario.
            <br>
            <br>
            - Additional defects found by exhaustive testing may not justify
            <br>
            - the resources invested in leaving no stone unturned.
            <br>
            <br>
            - Not all parts of an application are equally important
            <br>
            - or carry the same level of risk.
            <br>
            <br>
            - Testing should be concentrated on the areas that are most critical
            <br>
            - to the users and have the highest impact on the user experience. 
            <br>
            <br>
            - Not all bugs are worth fixing.

            <span class="sections"><b>A Holistic Approach to Quality</span></b></span>
            <br>
            My approach to quality assurance goes beyond finding bugs. I
            <br>
            look at the application as a whole, identifying gaps in requirements
            <br>
            and assessing not just functionality but the overall user experience.
            <br>
            Often, I find areas where the code meets the technical specifications,
            <br>
            but the spec itself didn't fully consider certain user perspectives or
            <br>
            scenarios. My goal is to provide feedback that aligns with real-world
            <br>
            usage, helping teams anticipate potential issues and improving the
            <br>
            product for end users. I aim for software that's as functional as it is
            <br>
            user-friendly.

            <span class="sections" id="work-style"><b>Work Style and Collaboration</b></span>
            <br>
            I know being upfront about my preferences might limit some
            <br>
            opportunities, but I'm more interested in finding the right fit
            <br>
            than just landing any job. I'm not here to craft a generic
            <br>
            LinkedIn profile full of safe, predictable statements that tick all
            <br>
            the boxes. This is my personal site, and I want to be transparent about
            <br>
            about where I thrive and where I don't. Trying to tell people what they
            <br>
            want to hear is a short-term move. I'm in it for the long haul, and
            <br>
            that starts with finding the right fit.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="orangeFont"><b>I value..</b></span>
            <br>
            thoughtful, independent work and can produce high-quality results
            <br>
            in less stressful environments. I perform best in environments
            <br>
            where I have the space to think things through and manage my tasks at
            <br>
            a steady, efficient pace. I prefer fewer meetings, minimal
            <br>
            distractions, and an asynchronous work style that allows me to focus
            <br>
            deeply and deliver quality work while still staying aligned with the
            <br>
            team. While I work best when I have time for deep focus and
            <br>
            independent tasks, I also thrive in smaller collaborative settings, such
            <br>
            as working closely with developers. I'm always ready to seek help when I
            <br>
            hit a roadblock or be there for the team when they need me.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="orangeFont"><b>I'm comfortable..</b></span>
            <br>
            with vague or evolving requirements. I don't need everything spelled
            <br>
            out for me or much handholding. In fact, I actually prefer unstructured
            <br>
            environments because they give me the freedom and autonomy to figure
            <br>
            things out as I go. I trust my judgment and experience to guide me when
            <br>
            things aren't perfectly laid out and enjoy the challenge of navigating
            <br>
            ambiguity. If something doesn't feel right, I'll ask for clarification,
            <br>
            but I'm comfortable with taking the initiative to find solutions
            <br>
            independently.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="orangeFont"><b>I'm not a fit for..</b></span>
            <br>
            environments that rely heavily on aggressive deadlines, hustle culture,
            <br>
            or rigid sprint planning based on initial story point estimates. I work
            <br>
            best in spaces where quality and thoughtful planning are prioritized
            <br>
            over fast-paced, high-pressure expectations.

            <br>
            I've worked in a mix of Waterfall and Agile setups, and it's been a
            <br>
            bit of a mashup. In some places, things were handed off to QA after
            <br>
            devs finished their initial coding, which was like Waterfall with Agile
            <br>
            ceremonies and a 2-week sprint sprinkled on top. Another place ran
            <br>
            more Kanban style, no timeboxed sprints, no deadlines. Also have been
            <br>
            involved in the design phase and at one place I was taking stakeholder
            <br>
            requests and turning them into requirements.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="orangeFont" id="agile-scrum-anti-patterns">Agile/Scrum Anti-Patterns</span> ‚ùå
            <br>
            Tying story points to hours is an anti-pattern. Story points are meant to
            <br>
            represent effort or complexity, not time. If you're linking them to hours,
            <br>
            you might as well just call them hours from the start.
            <br>
            <br>
            Dividing points evenly among the team is flawed. For example, if there are
            <br>
            30 points and 5 people, it doesn't mean each person gets 6 points. Story
            <br>
            points are about the collective effort, not individual quotas. Splitting
            <br>
            them like that assumes everyone's work takes the same amount of time
            <br>
            and effort, which is exactly what story points aren't meant to represent.
            <br>
            Team members have different strengths, and not every task is equal in
            <br>
            terms of complexity or effort. Plus, everyone works at their own pace,
            <br>
            so treating points like they're interchangeable leads to unrealistic
            <br>
            expectations.
            <br>
            <br>
            Another pitfall is treating estimates like commitments. Estimates are just
            <br>
            guesses based on what we know at the time, and they're often wrong. Yet,
            <br>
            in some places, once an estimate is made, it's treated like a firm
            <br>
            commitment.
            <br>
            <br>
            I've experienced a situation where QA points were determined as half of
            <br>
            dev points, which can oversimplify the complexity of testing. It's like
            <br>
            assuming cleaning the kitchen is always half the effort of cooking dinner.
            <br>
            <br>            
            When story points are treated like a timecard or a strict work quota, it
            <br>
            leads to micromanagement and puts too much emphasis on output
            <br>
            instead of quality. I've experienced that in one environment, and it's
            <br>
            not something I'd want to do again. Most places I've worked at were
            <br>
            much more flexible, focusing on collaboration, delivering value, and
            <br>
            continuous improvement over chasing numbers or rigid deadlines.

            <br>
            I find value in exploratory testing. It's the freedom to approach
            <br>
            testing naturally, seeing the software through the eyes of an end
            <br>
            user. Without the confinement of scripts, it opens the door to
            <br>
            creativity and adaptability. This flexibility allows me to uncover
            <br>
            issues that might otherwise slip through the cracks. It also
            <br>
            encourages usability and UX observations that may not be considered
            <br>
            during a structured test. It's where testing transforms into an art,
            <br>
            using my curiosity, intuition, and testing instinct to uncover
            <br>
            unexpected issues.

            <br>
            I'm all for automation, but I feel the idea of automating 
            <br>
            everything should be approached with caution.  I'm not jumping
            <br>
            on the automate everything bandwagon and recognize the pitfalls
            <br>
            of flaky tests and heavy maintenance burdens. It's not a
            <br>
            magic wand that makes manual testing disappear. There's a
            <br>
            misconception that it always saves time, but in reality, that's
            <br>
            not a guarantee. I believe in a balance between manual and
            <br>
            automated testing.
            <br>
            <br>
            - Automation doesn't eliminate the need for manual testing.
            <br>
            - Automation won't always save time over manual testing.
            <br>
            - Not every test is a good candidate or suitable for automation.
            <br>
            - Creating an automation script requires an initial time investment.
            <br>
            - Automation scripts require an ongoing time investment (maintenance).
            <br>
            - Automation suite can grow too big and become unmanageable.
            <br>
            - Be prepared to deal with and troubleshoot flaky tests.
            <br>
            - Automation often leads to unexpected challenges.
            <br> 
            <br> 
            Looking ahead is important. If the product roadmap says a part
            <br>
            of our site is getting a facelift in the next couple of months, 
            <br>
            maybe we shouldn't go all-in on automation scripts just yet. 
            <br>
            The last thing we want is to spend more time maintaining
            <br>
            automation scripts than we save by having them.
            <br>
            <br>
            Also we need to keep in mind that automated scripts can be sensitive,
            <br>
            behaving differently between environments. What works perfectly in
            <br>
