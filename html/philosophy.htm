            <b>Thoughts on Software Quality Assurance</b> üí≠
            <br>
            - It's impractical to test every possible scenario.
            <br>
            - Additional defects found by exhaustive testing may not justify
            <br>
            the resources invested in leaving no stone unturned.
            <br>
            - Not all parts of an application are equally important
            <br>
            or carry the same level of risk.
            <br>
            -Testing should be concentrated on the areas that are most critical
            <br>
            to the users and have the highest impact on the user experience. 
            <br>
            - Not all bugs are worth fixing.
            <br>
            - Allocate testing resources where they can provide the most value.
            <br>
            - Quality isn't just about bug hunting after coding is done.
            <br>
            - QA can provide input in early discussions to build a more solid product.
            <br>
            - Quality is a team effort. It's everyone's responsibility.

            <b>Thoughts on Manual Testing</b> üí≠
            <br>
            I find value in exploratory testing. It's the freedom to approach
            <br>
            testing naturally, seeing the software through the eyes of an end
            <br>
            user. Without the confinement of scripts, it opens the door to
            <br>
            creativity and adaptability. This flexibility allows me to uncover
            <br>
            issues that might otherwise slip through the cracks. It also
            <br>
            encourages usability and UX observations that may not be considered
            <br>
            during a structured test. It's where testing transforms into an art,
            <br>
            using my curiosity, intuition and testing instinct to uncover unexpected
            <br>
            issues.
            <br>
            <br>
            With that being said, I also appreciate the clarity and focus of 
            <br>
            scripted tests when needed for comprehensive quality assurance.

            <b>Thoughts on Automation Testing</b> üí≠
            <br>
            I'm all for automation, but I feel the idea of automating 
            <br>
            everything should be approached with caution. It's not a
            <br>
            magic wand that makes manual testing disappear. There's a
            <br>
            misconception that it always saves time, but in reality, that's
            <br>
            not a guarantee. I believe in a balance between manual and
            <br>
            automated testing.
            <br>
            <br>
            - Automation doesn't eliminate the need for manual testing.
            <br>
            - Automation won't always save time over manual testing.
            <br>
            - Not every test is a good candidate or suitable for automation.
            <br>
            - Creating an automation script requires an initial time investment.
            <br>
            - Automation scripts require an ongoing time investment (maintenance).
            <br>
            - Automation suite can grow too big and become unmanageable.
            <br>
            - Avoid getting stuck in a loop of constantly fixing automation scripts.
            <br>
            - Automation often leads to unexpected challenges.
            <br> 
            <br> 
            Looking ahead is important. If the product roadmap says a part
            <br>
            of our site is getting a facelift in the next couple of months, 
            <br>
            maybe we shouldn't go all-in on automation scripts just yet. 
            <br>
            The last thing we want is to spend more time maintaining
            <br>
            automation scripts than we save by having them.
            <br>
            <br>
            Also we need to keep in mind that automated scripts can be sensitive,
            <br>
            behaving differently between environments. What works perfectly in
            <br>
            the dev environment might throw a fit in a staging or production setting.
