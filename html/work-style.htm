            <br>
            <br>
            I know being upfront about my preferences might limit some
            <br>
            opportunities, but I'm more interested in finding the right fit
            <br>
            than just landing any job. I'm not here to craft a generic
            <br>
            LinkedIn profile full of safe, predictable statements that tick
            <br>
            all the boxes.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is my personal site, and I want to be transparent about about
            <br>
            where I thrive and where I don't. Trying to tell people what they
            <br>
            want to hear is a short-term move. I'm in it for the long haul,
            <br>
            and that starts with finding the right fit.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="orangeFont"><b>I value..</b></span>
            <br>
            thoughtful, independent work and can produce high-quality results
            <br>
            in less stressful environments. I perform best in environments
            <br>
            where the pace is steady and manageable, which allows me to
            <br>
            consistently deliver high-quality work without feeling overwhelmed.
            <br>
            While I work best when I have time for deep focus and independent
            <br>
            tasks, I also thrive in environments where collaboration is focused
            <br>
            and efficient, such as working closely with developers. I'm always
            <br>
            ready to seek help when I hit a roadblock or be there for the team
            <br>
            when they need me.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="orangeFont"><b>I'm comfortable..</b></span>
            <br>
            with vague or evolving requirements. I don't need everything spelled
            <br>
            out for me or much handholding. I actually like when things aren't
            <br>
            always perfectly defined. It gives me the freedom to think critically
            <br>
            and solve problems on my own. When there's ambiguity, I see it as a
            <br>
            chance to get creative and take initiative. It's not something I try
            <br>
            to avoid. It's more like an opportunity to trust my judgment, explore
            <br>
            different solutions, and figure out the best way forward, even if the
            <br>
            path isn't totally clear. I find that kind of flexibility pretty rewarding.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="orangeFont"><b>My Ideal Work Environment</b></span>
            <br>
            I've worked in a mix of Waterfall and Agile setups, and it's been a bit
            <br>
            of a mashup. In some places, things were handed off to QA after devs
            <br>
            finished their initial coding. In others, I've been involved in the design
            <br>
            phase, and at one place, I was taking stakeholder requests and turning
            <br>
            them into requirements. I actually prefer getting involved sooner. It
            <br>
            helps catch potential issues before they become bigger, time-consuming
            <br>
            adjustments later on.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Scrum</strong> feels like a more prescriptive way of doing Agile, with its
            <br>
            time-boxed sprints and ceremonies (meetings).  It's a bit more
            <br>
            structured than what I find works best for me. I've found it can be
            <br>
            harder to adapt to the level of oversight, as I tend to thrive in
            <br>
            environments where I have more independence. I've found that Scrum
            <br>
            can end up focusing too heavily on output and deadlines over quality,
            <br>
            which creates unnecessary stress that can hinder both individual
            <br>
            performance and overall team success.
            <br>
            <br>
            I prefer a more <strong>Kanban</strong> style approach, where the focus is on
            <br>
            flexibility, flow, and collaboration. There's less pressure around rigid
            <br>
            processes, and more emphasis on getting things done thoughtfully and
            <br>
            at a sustainable pace. Additionally, Kanban generally involves fewer
            <br>
            meetings, allowing for more time to focus on the actual work. I believe
            <br>
            Kanban aligns more with the spirit of the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agile Manifesto</a>, which
            <br>
            prioritizes flexibility, collaboration, and adaptability over rigid processes.
            <br>
            <br>
            That said, I've worked at one place that practiced what I'd call
            <br>
            <strong>"Light Scrum"</strong>, and it worked fairly well. There were no strict deadlines,
            <br>
            no story points, and the devs and I weren't shackled to the estimates we
            <br>
            made during sprint planning. It was more collaborative and less about
            <br>
            chasing numbers or rigid deadlines.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="sections" id="agile-scrum-anti-patterns">Agile/Scrum Anti-Patterns</span> ❌
            <br>
            <span class="orangeFont">Story points = hours?</span>
            <br>
            Tying story points to hours is an anti-pattern. Story points are meant to
            <br>
            represent effort or complexity, not time. If you're linking them to hours,
            <br>
            you might as well just call them hours from the start.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you divide story points equally among the team, you're treating them like
            <br>
            they're based on time, assuming each person will spend the same amount
            <br>
            of time on their tasks during the sprint. Splitting them evenly suggests
            <br>
            that everyone will contribute the same amount of effort, which isn't true.
            <br>
            Some tasks might be easier or harder for different people, and their pace
            <br>
            can vary.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="orangeFont">We'll ask for estimates then treat them as deadlines</span>
            <br>
            Another pitfall is treating estimates like commitments. Estimates are just
            <br>
            guesses based on what we know at the time, and they're often wrong. Yet,
            <br>
            in some places, once an estimate is made, it's treated like a firm
            <br>
            commitment.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="orangeFont">Assuming cleaning the kitchen is always half the effort of cooking dinner</span>
            <br>
            I've experienced a situation where QA points were determined as half of
            <br>
            dev points, which can oversimplify the complexity of testing and didn't
            <br>
            reflect the true effort involved.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="orangeFont">The story point trap</span>
            <br>         
            When story points are treated like a timecard or a strict work quota, it
            <br>
            leads to micromanagement and puts too much emphasis on output
            <br>
            instead of quality. I've experienced that in one environment, and it's
            <br>
            not something I'd want to do again. Most places I've worked at were
            <br>
            much more flexible, focusing on collaboration, delivering value, and
            <br>
            continuous improvement over chasing numbers or rigid deadlines.
