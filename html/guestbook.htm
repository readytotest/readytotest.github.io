      Comment:
      <br>
      <textarea data-testid="comment0" readonly class="guestbook-input" rows="15">Eli expanded my notion of what to expect from a QA Engineer. He is excellent at the core job -- he is extremely thorough; he produces flawless documentation of issues he comes across, leaving no question of how to find and reproduce the issue; he does excellent work on testing automation and learned a legit amount of javascript while on our team -- but he does so much more than that. I've found Eli to have a great grasp of how technical products should work holistically, and his feedback regularly uncovers not just implementation bugs but holes in the requirements or places where the requirements lead to imperfect user experiences more generally. Our team decided to start involving him in the design phase so that he could bring these types of issues to light earlier in the process, allowing us to produce better specs up front. In short, Eli is dynamic and able to contribute to a product and engineering organization in multiple ways, and I have thoroughly enjoyed being a part of the same team. He's a very genuine and earnest person, always looking to learn and improve, and I'd highly recommend him for any product and engineering team.</textarea>

      Comment:
      <br>
      <textarea data-testid="comment2" readonly class="guestbook-input" rows="15">I had the privilege of working with Eli at Grayce where he was the QA Engineer on our team. Eli is exceptional. As a QA Engineer, he leaves no stone unturned. When Eli started on our team, we were within weeks of releasing a new version of our product, so we asked him to onboarding, learn the app, and put it through exploratory testing within the first few weeks. Eli was thorough, asked insightful questions about the product, how it was supposed to work, and what our main objectives were. It was a large project, to say the least, for our first QA Engineer, and his skills shone through. Eli was the first QA Engineer on our team, and we called upon him to recommend and set up workflows to seamlessly integrate QA into our development workflows. When I asked Eli for recommendations on tooling, workflows, or really anything, he gave them freely and always with fantastic reasoning. And he’s flexible on whatever the team chooses to implement. As a person, Eli is kind, honest, and generous with his time. He’s always looking to help others, whether on a product issue, writing a ticket, or giving advice on how to fix my car.  I would highly recommend Eli for any team, and if given the chance, I’d work with him again in a heartbeat!</textarea>

He is an exceptional tester and more important, a team player. He is very collaborative and I really appreciate it, especially due to the time zone differences.</textarea>
