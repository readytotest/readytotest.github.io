            <span class="sections">Intro</span>
            <br>
            You might be wondering what a well lid project is doing on a tech-focused
            <br>
            site. The answer is simple: it‚Äôs a reflection of my approach to work. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This project shows you how I tackle problems, whether they're in the realm
            <br>
            of QA or building something with my own two hands. I‚Äôm about rolling up
            <br>
            my sleeves, figuring things out as I go, and applying that same mindset to
            <br>
            every challenge I face. It‚Äôs not just about following procedures or
            <br>
            guidelines. It‚Äôs about being resourceful, self-sufficient, and learning by
            <br>
            doing. Whether it‚Äôs code or construction, I don‚Äôt wait for the perfect plan.
            <br>
            I take ownership of projects, diving in without needing step-by-step
            <br>
            guidance and seeing where it takes me. I‚Äôm not afraid to mess up along
            <br>
            the way because that‚Äôs how you learn what works.
            <br>
            <br>
            This well lid project reminds me of learning about test automation. I‚Äôm not
            <br>
            a handyman or a developer, but I‚Äôm curious about how things work and
            <br>
            can figure things out on my own. I like being self-sufficient,
            <br>
            self-reliant, and knowing I can solve problems myself. I don‚Äôt need
            <br>
            handholding, though I‚Äôll ask for help when I‚Äôve exhausted all other
            <br>
            resources. It‚Äôs all about taking the initiative and learning by doing.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="sections">Details</span>
            <br>
            The original well lid was unfinished plywood, poorly built by someone else
            <br>
            before me. It was warped, the plies were delaminating, and it was just set
            <br>
            on top of the culvert with some 2x4‚Äôs underneath to keep it from falling off.
            <br>
            Not the best setup.
            <br>
            <br>
            I wanted to make sure the new lid was functional, sturdy, and properly
            <br>
            finished. So, I used 4'x4' square BCX plywood for the lid, giving it
            <br>
            three coats of exterior primer and three coats of exterior paint for
            <br>
            durability. Beneath the lid, I cut a circular piece of XPS foam board
            <br>
            to fit inside the culvert opening. This served two purposes: keeping
            <br>
            the lid from shifting off and adding insulation. Note: Use PL300
            <br>
            adhesive. It won't melt the foam board like standard adhesive. There
            <br>
            were some 1/4" to 1/2" gaps on two sides, so instead of starting over,
            <br>
            I added some 3/4" rubber foam weatherstrip tape to seal those edges.
            <br>
            <br>
            To secure the lid, I used a 2/0 zinc coated chain and padlocks, making
            <br>
            sure everything was locked in place. Instead of buying padlock hasps
            <br>
            with eyes, I went with shade sail eyes for the anchor points. Drilling
            <br>
            holes in the concrete culvert to secure the eyes, I used masonry bits
            <br>
            and concrete screws. It was doable with a regular drill, but if you‚Äôre
            <br>
            planning on doing this yourself, trust me, a hammer drill or rotary
            <br> hammer makes it go a lot faster.
            <br>
            <br>
            I also dug a small trench around the well‚Äôs circumference to make sure
            <br>
            water could flow away from the opening since before, the culvert was at
            <br>
            ground level. For added safety, I attached black carrying handles,
            <br>
            reflective warning signs, and marked the perimeter with four driveway
            <br>
            snow stakes. The entire process, while challenging, gave me the 
            <br>
            satisfaction of having built something that not only works but is designed
            <br>
            to last.
