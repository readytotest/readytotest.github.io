            Water Well Lid Project üö∞ <a href ="#well-photos">(Photos at bottom)</a>
            <br>
            <a href="/index.htm">Go back ‚Æê</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="sections">Intro</span>
            <br>
            You might be wondering what a well lid project is doing on a tech-focused
            <br>
            site. The answer is simple: it reflects my approach to learning and
            <br>
            problem-solving. I'm not a handyman or a developer, but whether it's
            <br>
            building a well lid or learning automation, I tackle challenges the same
            <br>
            way: by rolling up my sleeves, doing the research, experimenting, and
            <br>
            improving as I go. It's about being resourceful, self-sufficient, and
            <br>
            learning by doing, not waiting for the perfect plan or following a
            <br>
            step-by-step guide. I'm not afraid to make mistakes because that's how
            <br>
            you figure out what works.
            <br>
            <br>
            The well lid project is a perfect example of how I approach challenges and
            <br>
            learning. Just like with coding and automation, it started as a mystery. But
            <br>
            through research, experimentation, and learning from mistakes, I figured it
            <br>
            out. It's the same thought process. For me, the process of building a well
            <br>
            lid mirrors the way I've learned new tech skills. Both involve the unknown,
            <br>
            problem-solving, and continuously improving. It's all about jumping in,
            <br>
            learning by doing, and enjoying the journey.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Problem solving and learning are universal skills.</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="sections">Details</span>
            <br>
            The original well lid was unfinished plywood, poorly built by someone else
            <br>
            before me. It was warped, the plies were delaminating, and it was just set
            <br>
            on top of the culvert with some 2x4's underneath to keep it from falling off.
            <br>
            Not the best setup. I put a large rock on top of it as a temporary stopgap
            <br>
            to prevent it from blowing off in high winds until I could figure out
            <br>
            something more permanent.
            <br>
            <br>
            I wanted to make sure the new lid was functional, sturdy, and properly
            <br>
            finished. So, I used 4'x4' square BCX plywood for the lid, giving it
            <br>
            three coats of exterior primer and three coats of exterior paint for
            <br>
            durability. Beneath the lid, I cut a circular piece of XPS foam board
            <br>
            to fit inside the culvert opening. This served two purposes: keeping
            <br>
            the lid from shifting off and adding insulation. Note: Use PL300
            <br>
            adhesive. It won't melt the foam board like standard adhesive. There
            <br>
            were some 1/4" to 1/2" gaps on two sides, so instead of starting over,
            <br>
            I added some 3/4" rubber foam weatherstrip tape to seal those edges.
            <br>
            <br>
            To secure the lid, I used a 2/0 zinc coated chain and padlocks, making
            <br>
            sure everything was locked in place. Instead of buying padlock hasps
            <br>
            with eyes, I went with shade sail eyes for the anchor points. Drilling
            <br>
            holes in the concrete culvert to secure the eyes, I used masonry bits
            <br>
            and concrete screws. It was doable with a regular drill, but if you're
            <br>
            planning on doing this yourself, trust me, a hammer drill or rotary
            <br> hammer makes it go a lot faster.
            <br>
            <br>
            I also dug a small trench around the well's circumference to make sure
            <br>
            water could flow away from the opening since before, the culvert was at
            <br>
            ground level. For added safety, I attached black carrying handles,
            <br>
            reflective warning signs, and marked the perimeter with four driveway
            <br>
            snow stakes. The entire process, while challenging, gave me the 
            <br>
            satisfaction of having built something that not only works but is designed
            <br>
            to last.            
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="orangeFont"><strong>New Iteration: Ventilation Upgrade</strong></span>
            <br>
            After some rain and snow, I found condensation under the lid and needed
            <br>
            airflow. I drilled three holes with a 1 1/4" hole saw, covered them with
            <br>
            a 16" x 4" aluminum grille, and sealed the edges with silicone. A screen
            <br>
            behind the grille keeps out yellow jackets, and the holes should be small
            <br>
            enough to release moisture without letting in too much water or cold air.
            <br>
            I also added extra handles. I'll inspect it periodically to see if it works
            <br>
            or needs adjusting.
