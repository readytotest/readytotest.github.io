            <span class="sections">Intro</span>
            <br>
            You might be wondering what a well lid project is doing on a tech-focused site.
            <br>
            The answer is simple: it‚Äôs a reflection of my approach to work. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This project shows you how I tackle problems, whether they're in the realm of
            <br>
            QA or building something with my own two hands. I‚Äôm about rolling up my sleeves,
            <br>
            figuring things out as I go, and applying that same mindset to every challenge 
            <br>
            I face. It‚Äôs not just about following procedures or guidelines. It‚Äôs about being
            <br>
            resourceful, self-sufficient, and learning by doing. Whether it‚Äôs code or
            <br>
            construction, I don‚Äôt wait for the perfect plan. I take ownership of projects,
            <br>
            diving in without needing step-by-step guidance and seeing where it takes me.
            <br>
            I‚Äôm not afraid to mess up along the way because that‚Äôs how you learn what works.
            <br>
            <br>
            This well lid project reminds me of learning about test automation. I‚Äôm not a
            <br>
            handyman or a developer, but I‚Äôm curious about how things work and can figure
            <br>
            things out on my own. I like being self-sufficient, self-reliant, and knowing
            <br>
            I can solve problems myself. I don‚Äôt need handholding, though I‚Äôll ask for help
            <br>
            when I‚Äôve exhausted all other resources. It‚Äôs all about taking the initiative
            <br>
            and learning by doing.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="sections">Details</span>
            <br>
            The original well lid was unfinished plywood, poorly built by someone else before
            <br>
            me. It was warped, the plies were delaminating, and it was just set on top of the
            <br>
            culvert with some 2x4‚Äôs underneath to keep it from falling off. Not the best setup.
            <br>
            <br>
            I wanted to make sure the new lid was functional, sturdy, and properly finished.
            <br>
            So, I used 4'x4' square BCX plywood for the lid, giving it three coats of exterior
            <br>
            primer and three coats of exterior paint for durability. Beneath the lid, I cut a
            <br>
            circular piece of XPS foam board to fit inside the culvert opening. This served two
            <br>
            purposes: keeping the lid from shifting off and adding insulation. Note: Use PL300
            <br>
            adhesive. It won't melt the foam board like standard adhesive. There were some 1/4"
            <br>
            to 1/2" gaps on two sides, so instead of starting over, I added some 3/4" rubber foam
            <br>
            weatherstrip tape to seal those edges.
            <br>
            <br>
            To secure the lid, I used a 2/0 zinc coated chain and padlocks, making sure everything
            <br>
            was locked in place. Instead of buying padlock hasps with eyes, I went with shade
            <br>
            sail eyes for the anchor points. Drilling holes in the concrete culvert to secure the
            <br>
            eyes, I used masonry bits and concrete screws. It was doable with a regular drill, but
            <br>
            if you‚Äôre planning on doing this yourself, trust me, a hammer drill or rotary hammer
            <br>
            makes it go a lot faster.
            <br>
            <br>
            I also dug a small trench around the well‚Äôs circumference to make sure water could flow
            <br>
            away from the opening since before, the culvert was at ground level. For added safety,
            <br>
            I attached black carrying handles, 3M reflective warning signs, and marked the perimeter
            <br>
            with four driveway snow stakes. The entire process, while challenging, gave me the 
            <br>
            satisfaction of having built something that not only works but is designed to last.
