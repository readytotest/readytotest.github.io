            <br>
            My QA journey has roots in usability testing and UX research projects.
            <br>
            From there, I got into manual testing, learned a bit about JavaScript at
            <br>
            another job, and most recently have been working with test automation.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before finding my passion in quality assurance (QA), my career path
            <br>
            took me through various roles, including IT. I hold a few CompTIA
            <br>
            certifications that are considered Good-for-Life (GFL). While these
            <br>
            certifications are still considered active, it's important to note that
            <br>
            they reflect a historical snapshot of my expertise.
            <br>
            <br>
            These hands-on roles in IT have equipped me with a strong foundation in
            <br>
            troubleshooting, problem-solving, and analyzing complex systems. The 
            <br>
            analytical skills gained during my IT career are assets that I now bring
            <br>
            to QA.
