    <a href="/index.htm">Go back ‚Æê</a>
    <br />
    <br />
    My QA journey has roots in usability testing and UX research projects.
    <br />
    From there, I got into manual testing, learned a bit about JavaScript at
    <br />
    another job, and most recently have been working with test automation.
    <br />
    <br />
    In three of my four QA roles, I was the first and only QA hire at small
    <br />
    companies, so it was just me and a few developers, making for a really
    <br />
    tight-knit team. In my other role, I worked with a team of five QA
    <br />
    Analysts, where things were more defined and structured.
    <br />
    <br />
    I'm someone who thinks beyond the basics and doesn't just follow the
    <br />
    checklist of ‚ÄúDid this pass or fail?‚Äù I'm understands the full picture
    <br />
    of quality, seeing the application from a user's perspective, and diving
    <br />
    into exploratory testing to find things that aren't obvious on the surface.
    <br />
    I feel the critical thinking aspect, especially in identifying gaps in the
    <br />
    specs before coding starts is a huge asset.
    <br />
    <br />
    My approach to quality assurance goes beyond finding bugs. I
    <br />
    look at the application as a whole, identifying gaps in requirements
    <br />
    and assessing not just functionality but the overall user experience.
    <br />
    Often, I find areas where the code meets the technical specifications,
    <br />
    but the spec itself didn't fully consider certain user perspectives or
    <br />
    scenarios. My goal is to provide feedback that aligns with real-world
    <br />
    usage, helping teams anticipate potential issues and improving the
    <br />
    product for end users. I aim for software that's as functional as it is
    <br />
    user-friendly.
    <br />
    <br />
    Don't be deceived by all this tinkering with code. I enjoy and dedicate
    <br />
    a lot of time to manual hands-on testing, especially exploratory testing.
    <br />
    I love the freedom it gives me to uncover issues in creative ways. I
    <br />
    prefer to dive in, trust my instincts, and see what breaks. I'm motivated
    <br />
    by curiosity and the freedom of discovering issues through exploration.
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="sections"><b>Bug Report Style</b></span>
    <br />
    <br />
    When I'm reporting a bug, I don't just toss out some dry steps and
    <br />
    call it a day. I make sure to <strong>walk you through it</strong>. Every step, and
    <br />
    every bit of the breakdown. I'll show you where things went off
    <br />
    track and what should've happened instead. For more complex issues,
    <br />
    I'll create a video and <strong>narrate the whole thing</strong>, so you're not
    <br />
    left guessing. You'll hear exactly what's going wrong, why it matters,
    <br />
    and how we can fix it<strong> clearly</strong>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="sections"><b>Example of My Bug Report Breakdown:</b></span>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Preconditions:</strong> Establishing the context for the bug, if necessary.</li>
      <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Browser, OS, mobile, desktop, etc..</li>
      <li><strong>Steps to Reproduce:</strong> Here's exactly how to make it happen.</li>
      <li><strong>Actual Result:</strong> What went wrong, plain and simple.</li>
      <li><strong>Expected Result:</strong> This is what was supposed to happen.</li>
      <li><strong>Screenshot(s):</strong> A picture speaks a thousand words...</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Narrated Video Walk-through:</strong> I'm talking through it, explaining
        <br />
        every step, every detail, <strong>so you get it</strong>. No guesswork, no
        <br />
        confusion. Just clarity.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Notes:</strong> Additional info, console errors, links to related tickets, etc.</li>
    </ol>
    <span class="sections"><b>Bug Triage and Prioritization</b></span>
    <br />
    <br />
    If it's a bug that's not urgent, I'd just throw it in the backlog and let
    <br />
    the product team review it when they're sorting out the next sprint.
    <br />
    However, if it's critical, or needs fixing soon, I'd message the PM or Dev,
    <br />
    or tag them in the Jira ticket.
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="sections"><b>Analyzing and Troubleshooting: From IT to QA</b></span>
    <br />
    <br />
    In addition to QA, I also have experience in IT support and have a few
    <br />
    computer and networking certifications.
