    <span class="sections">Roots in UX: The Beginning and Outlook</span>
    <br />
    My journey began in usability testing and UX research, which gave me a
    <br />
    deep understanding of how users interact with products. Since then, I see
    <br />
    software through a UX-first lens that others often overlook, focusing on
    <br />
    the user experience alongside functionality. From there, I transitioned
    <br />
    into manual testing, learned a bit about JavaScript at another job, and
    <br />
    recently have been working with test automation, TypeScript, and CI/CD.
    <br />
    <blockquote class="markdown-style-quote">
      üí°I don't need perfect requirements to start testing. I work through
      <br />
      ambiguity, trust my instincts, and ask questions when things feel off.
      <br />
      For pure UX/usability testing, I prefer no requirements at all. I test
      <br />
      exactly how a user would, for real.

    <br />
    <span class="sections">Sole QA to a QA Team: Experienced in Different Environments</span>
    <br />
    In three of my four QA roles, I was the first and only QA hire at small
    <br />
    companies, so it was just me, a few developers, and a product manager,
    <br />
    making for a really tight-knit team. One of the places didn't have
    <br />
    a product manager, so I helped out with gathering and refining
    <br />
    requirements from stakeholders. In my other role, I worked with a team
    <br />
    of five QA analysts and three product managers.
    <br />
    <blockquote class="markdown-style-quote">
      üí°Flexibility mattered more than heavy docs or rigid processes.
      <br />
      I've had to be adaptable and ready to jump in wherever needed.

    <br />
    <span class="sections">Beyond the Checklist: Thinking Critically</span>
    <br />
    I think beyond the basics and don't just follow a checklist of
    <br />
    ‚ÄúDid this pass or fail?‚Äù My approach to QA is more about exploration
    <br />
    and critical thinking than just following structured test cases. It
    <br />
    isn't just about confirming if something works, but is also asking,
    <br />
    Should it work this way? How well does it work? How secure is it?
    <br />
    Does it make sense for users? A feature might work as designed, but
    <br />
    that doesn't always mean it works well. Does it guide users smoothly
    <br />
    or create friction?
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="sections">Getting QA Involved Early = Better Outcomes</span>
    <br />
    By reviewing designs and specs upfront, I can help the product team
    <br />
    refine requirements, clarify details, and provide feedback on the UX
    <br />
    design before development starts. Often, I find areas where the code
    <br />
    meets the technical specifications, but the spec itself didn't fully
    <br />
    consider certain user perspectives or scenarios. This way, we reduce
    <br />
    the need for rework later, minimize questions during testing, and
    <br />
    avoid clearing up issues down the line.
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="sections">Not Just Coding: Hands-On Testing Driven by Curiosity</span>
    <br />
    Don't be deceived by all this tinkering with code. I enjoy and dedicate
    <br />
    a lot of time to manual hands-on testing, especially exploratory testing.
    <br />
    I love the freedom it gives me to uncover issues in creative ways. I
    <br />
    jump in, trust my instincts, and see what breaks. I'm motivated by
    <br />
    curiosity and the freedom of discovering issues through exploration.
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="sections" id="identifying-risks">Identifying Risks: QA That Considers Business Impact</span>
    <br />
    I focus on identifying risks that could impact the business, not only
    <br />
    finding the bugs. Instead of saying, "Here's a bug, this doesn't work."
    <br />
    I ask, "How might users react? How could this affect the company?"
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="sections">Clear and Detailed Bug Reporting</span>
    <ol>
      <li>Preconditions: Establishing the context for the bug, if necessary.</li>
      <li>Environment: Browser, OS, mobile, desktop, etc.</li>
      <li>Steps to Reproduce: Here's exactly how to make it happen.</li>
      <li>Actual Result: What went wrong, plain and simple.</li>
      <li>Expected Result:This is what was supposed to happen.</li>
      <li>Screenshot(s):A picture speaks a thousand words.</li>
      <li>Narrated Video Walk-through: For complex bugs</li>
      <li>Notes: Additional info, console errors, links to related tickets, etc.</li>
    </ol>
    <span class="yellowFont">Exception</span>: If we're moving fast, and I know the devs have context
    <br />
    I might just put Actual vs Expected and a screenshot, as that's all
    <br />
    they'll need. I have a good feel for when to go into detail and when
    <br />
    to keep it simple.
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="sections">Bug Triage and Prioritization</span>
    <br />
    If it's a bug that's not urgent, I'd just throw it in the backlog and let
    <br />
    the product team review it when they're sorting out the next sprint.
    <br />
    However, if it's critical, or needs fixing soon, I'd message the PM or
    <br />
    Dev, or tag them in the Jira ticket.
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="sections">Analyzing and Troubleshooting: From IT to QA</span>
    <br />
    In addition to QA, I also have experience in IT support, networking,
    <br />
    and server administration. I also have a few computer certifications.
    <br />
    <br />
    I'm still hands-on with IT. At home, I've set up VLAN tagging and
    <br />
    SSID segmentation to separate traffic into multiple networks.
    <br />
    IoT devices, guests, and trusted systems are isolated for security.
    <br />
    Firewall rules control traffic between these subnets and the WAN.
    <br />
    An Intrusion Detection and Prevention system (IDS/IPS) monitors
    <br />
    and helps block security risks.
