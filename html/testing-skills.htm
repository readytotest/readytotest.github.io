    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="sections"><b>Roots in UX: The Beginning and Outlook</b></span>
    <br />
    My journey began in usability testing and UX research, which gave me a
    <br />
    deep understanding of how users interact with products. Since then, I see
    <br />
    software through a UX-first lens that others often overlook, focusing on
    <br />
    the user experience alongside functionality. From there, I transitioned
    <br />
    into manual testing, learned a bit about JavaScript at another job, and
    <br />
    most recently have been working with test automation.
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="sections">Sole QA to a QA Team: Experienced in Different Environments</span>
    <br />
    In three of my four QA roles, I was the first and only QA hire at small
    <br />
    companies, so it was just me, a few developers, and a product manager,
    <br />
    making for a really tight-knit team. One of the places didn't have
    <br />
    a product manager, so I helped out with gathering and refining
    <br />
    requirements from stakeholders. In my other role, I worked with a team
    <br />
    of five QA analysts and three product managers where things were much
    <br />
    more defined and structured.
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="sections">Beyond the Checklist: Thinking Critically</span>
    <br />
    I'm someone who thinks beyond the basics and doesn't just follow
    <br />
    the checklist of “Did this pass or fail?” My approach to QA is more
    <br />
    about exploration and critical thinking than just following structured
    <br />
    test cases. My real strength? Finding issues others miss or don't think
    <br />
    about. It isn't just about confirming if something works, but is also
    <br />
    asking, Should it work this way? How well does it work? How secure is
    <br />
    it? Does it make sense for users? A feature might work as designed, but
    <br />
    that doesn't always mean it works well. Does it guide users smoothly
    <br />
    or create friction?
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="sections">Looking at the Specs: Are There Gaps in the Product?</span>
    <br />
    I look at the application as a whole, identifying gaps in requirements
    <br />
    and assess not just functionality but the overall user experience.
    <br />
    Often, I find areas where the code meets the technical specifications,
    <br />
    but the spec itself didn't fully consider certain user perspectives or
    <br />
    scenarios. My goal is to provide feedback that aligns with real-world
    <br />
    usage, helping teams anticipate potential issues and improving the
    <br />
    product for end users.
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="sections">Getting QA Involved Early = Better Outcomes</span>
    <br />
    QA works best when I'm involved early. I catch issues before they turn
    <br />
    into bigger problems, even before development starts. By reviewing designs
    <br />
    and specs upfront, I can catch potential issues early and ensure smoother
    <br />
    development down the line.
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="sections">Not Just Coding: Hands-On Testing Driven by Curiosity</span>
    <br />
    Don't be deceived by all this tinkering with code. I enjoy and dedicate
    <br />
    a lot of time to manual hands-on testing, especially exploratory testing.
    <br />
    I love the freedom it gives me to uncover issues in creative ways. I
    <br />
    dive in headfirst, trust my instincts, and see what breaks. I'm motivated
    <br />
    by curiosity and the freedom of discovering issues through exploration.
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="sections">Identifying Risks: QA That Considers Business Impact</span>
    <br />
    I focus on identifying risks that could impact the business, not
    <br />
    only finding the bugs.
    <br />
    <br />
    Instead of simply saying, "Here's a bug, this doesn't work."
    <br />
    <br />
    I ask, "How might users react? How could this affect the company?"
    <br />
    <br />
    When building an app, it's not just about the features, it's also
    <br />
    about considering the real-world impact of the product's design.
    <br />
    Are we overlooking something that could frustrate users, damage the
    <br />
    experience, or even hurt the brand? QA isn't just about testing.
    <br />
    It's about understanding the bigger picture, anticipating risks, and
    <br />
    ensuring the product succeeds on every level.
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="sections">Clear and Detailed Bug Reporting</span>
    <br />
    When I'm reporting a bug, I don't just toss out some dry steps and
    <br />
    call it a day. I make sure to <strong>walk you through it</strong>. Every step, and
    <br />
    every bit of the breakdown. I'll show you where things went off
    <br />
    track and what should've happened instead. For more complex issues,
    <br />
    I'll create a video and <strong>narrate the whole thing</strong>, so you're not
    <br />
    left guessing. You'll hear exactly what's going wrong, why it matters,
    <br />
    and how we can fix it<strong> clearly</strong>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="sections">Example of My Bug Report Breakdown</span>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Preconditions:</strong> Establishing the context for the bug, if necessary.</li>
      <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Browser, OS, mobile, desktop, etc..</li>
      <li><strong>Steps to Reproduce:</strong> Here's exactly how to make it happen.</li>
      <li><strong>Actual Result:</strong> What went wrong, plain and simple.</li>
      <li><strong>Expected Result:</strong> This is what was supposed to happen.</li>
      <li><strong>Screenshot(s):</strong> A picture speaks a thousand words...</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Narrated Video Walk-through:</strong> I'm talking through it, explaining
        <br />
        every step, every detail, <strong>so you get it</strong>. No guesswork, no
        <br />
        confusion. Just clarity.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Notes:</strong> Additional info, console errors, links to related tickets, etc.</li>
    </ol>
    <span class="sections">Bug Triage and Prioritization</span>
    <br />
    If it's a bug that's not urgent, I'd just throw it in the backlog and let
    <br />
    the product team review it when they're sorting out the next sprint.
    <br />
    However, if it's critical, or needs fixing soon, I'd message the PM or
    <br />
    Dev, or tag them in the Jira ticket.
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="sections">Analyzing and Troubleshooting: From IT to QA</span>
    <br />
    In addition to QA, I also have experience in IT support, networking,
    <br />
    and server administration. I also have a few computer certifications.
    <br />
    <br />
    I'm still hands-on with IT. At home, I've set up VLAN tagging and
    <br />
    SSID segmentation to separate traffic into multiple networks.
    <br />
    IoT devices, guests, and trusted systems are isolated for security.
    <br />
    Firewall rules control traffic between these subnets and the WAN.
    <br />
    An Intrusion Detection and Prevention system (IDS/IPS) monitors
    <br />
    and helps block security risks.
