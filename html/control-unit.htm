    You can do a lot yourself and learn a ton, all thanks to the info
    <br />
    available online today. Many people won't even pop their hood unless
    <br />
    there's smoke coming out of it, but what would've been a pricey trip
    <br />
    to the dealer turned into a simple DIY fix!
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="sections">Problem</span>
    <br />
    My wife comes into the room and goes, "The car alarm's going off.
    <br />
    Are you sitting on the keys?" I wasn't, but I go outside to check
    <br />
    it out. The alarm's blaring and I can't get the keyfob to do anything.
    <br />
    It's unresponsive. I can't unlock the doors and I can't shut it off.
    <br />
    I use the actual key to open the door, old-school style. Still doesn't
    <br />
    stop the alarm. It's been going off a while now, and I'm a little
    <br />
    concerned that a neighbor's going to show up. Dashboard's lit up like
    <br />
    a christmas tree with warning lights, and I can hear relays clicking
    <br />
    like crazy.

      üí° First, It's important to analyze the problem and see if you
      <br />
      think you can solve it. Know the stakes and own your decisions.
      <br />
      Often things like this go sideways and if you jump in without a
      <br />
      backup plan and things go south, then you're just left with you,
      <br />
      the problem, and a bigger mess you created. Are you ready to
      <br />
      handle it if you make the problem worse or can't can't crack it?

    <span class="sections">Troubleshooting</span>
    <br />
    I head to the garage, but can't remember what socket size I need
    <br />
    for the battery terminal, so I just grab an adjustable wrench to
    <br />
    disconnect it. Finally, everything goes quiet. Figured maybe it just
    <br />
    needed a reset, so I reconnect the battery. Dashboard's still going
    <br />
    haywire. Try to start the car... nothing. I disconnect and reconnect
    <br />
    the battery a few times, hoping it'll snap out of it but no luck.
    <br />
    Next move? I look it up. Found a YouTube video of someone fixing
    <br />
    the same problem, plus a TSB on the NHTSA site about a similar
    <br />
    issue in a different model.

    <span class="sections">Solution</span>
    <br />
    Turns out the fix doesn't even involve a trip to the dealer. All you
    <br />
    have to do it pull off some trim to remove the glovebox and pull out
    <br />
    the keyless entry/TPMS module. I thought getting the glovebox out
    <br />
    would be a pain, but it wasn't bad, definitely easier than pulling
    <br />
    apart the dashboard in my truck just to replace the cabin filter.
    <br />
    <br />
    The real challenge was opening up the module without breaking it.
    <br />
    It took about a half-hour to carefully get it open so I could clean
    <br />
    off the

      >dendritic growth</a
    >
    with a cotton swab and some alcohol that
    <br />
    was shorting one of the integrated circuits. Once that was done, I
    <br />
    plugged it back in, <span class="italic">tested it before reassembling everything</span> and
    <br />
    it worked! Problem solved. Saved myself about a thousand bucks
    <br />
    from the dealer who would've happily charged for a new part and
    <br />
    labor.

      üí°Looking back, I knew what the stakes were and I was willing

      to take responsibility for my choice to DIY. What was my plan
      <br />
      B? I'd have towed the car to the dealer if all else failed and
      <br />
      was comfortable with the fact that I might break something
      <br />
      and make it cost more than it would've in the first place.
