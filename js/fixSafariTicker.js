// -----------------------------------------------------
// The below script is a workaround since Safari has issues with scrolling text in CSS
// Safari mishandles the CSS animations in the weather ticker
// after page reloads due to caching issues. The animation can slow down or become inconsistent 
// until the cache is cleared. This script works around that by forcing the browser to
// recalculate the animation on page load.
// -----------------------------------------------------

window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    const weatherAlert = document.querySelector('.weather-alert');
    
    // Force a reflow by reading the offsetHeight
    weatherAlert.style.animation = 'none'; // Temporarily stop the animation
    /* The next line forces the browser to recalculate the layout, refreshing the element’s rendering.
    The logging part isn't necessary for the functionality, but it’s added here as a visible reminder
    of what’s happening when the offsetHeight is accessed. */
    console.log('Accessing offsetHeight forces the browser to recalculate styles. The value of offsetHeight is', weatherAlert.offsetHeight, 'pixels, which represents the height of the .weather-alert-container element.');
    weatherAlert.style.animation = ''; // Restart the animation
  });
