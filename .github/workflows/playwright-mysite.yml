# ╔═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
# ║  We have two separate Playwright config files.              ║
# ║  Why? Running Playwright locally, I want the tests to       ║
# ║  run in headed mode and slowMo so I can watch them, but     ║
# ║  I don't want that in the CI env. And locally...            ║
# ║  I run one spec at a time and one test at a time so I can   ║
# ║  watch it playback, whereas in CI/CD the tests run in       ║
# ║  parallel for faster execution.                             ║
# ║                                                             ║
# ║  If you explore the root of the test-playwright repo, you'll║
# ║  find two separate configuration files.                     ║
# ║  playwright.actions.config.ts (for GitHub Actions)          ║
# ║  playwright.config.ts (for running tests locally)           ║
# ║  I created a GitHub Actions variable to specify the CI      ║
# ║  version of the config to run in the GitHub runner          ║
# ║  environment.                                               ║

# Note:
# Tests are triggered on both push and pull_request events,
# which results in duplicate runs (for PRs).
#
# Since I push directly to 'main' for most updates (except Dependabot PRs),
# this setup works fine for me.
#
# I could split the workflow into two to avoid this, but it doesn't really matter
# for this personal project.
#
# Additionally, I have GitGuardian configured both through YAML and as a GitHub
# App integration. This results in redundant checks, but I wanted to see how both
# approaches work in practice.
#
# For real company production environments, pushing directly to 'main' is usually
# disabled, and you’d typically remove the push event from this YAML and only use
# PRs (or maybe manual events).
#
# Also, you'd choose either the GitHub App integration or the YAML-based
# configuration, not both, to avoid redundant checks.
