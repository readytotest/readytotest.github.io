name: Playwright GitHub Page (manual, pr/push)
#I'm using a different Playwright configuration for Github Actions
#because I like to have sloMo and headed mode enabled in my local 
#environment so I can watch the tests run and I don't want those settings in the
#GitHub runner..otherwise I'd have an unstaged change of the config file always
#present. Having unique config files for Playwright local vs CI/CD solves the problem.
#So I created a repository variable in the GitHub repo settings and included it
#in this YAML below, and further down below you can see I used the --config flag 
#and specify the variable when starting the tests
#If you go look in the root of the Playwright repo, you'll see two separate config files
