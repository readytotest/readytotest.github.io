# We have two separate Playwright config files.
# Why? Running Playwright locally, I want it the tests to
# run in headed mode and slowMo so I can watch them, but
# I don't want that in the CI env. Also I don't want the old
# class based tests running in the CI env either.
# If you explore the root of the test-playwright repo, you'll find two separate
# configuration files.
# playwright.actions.config.ts (for GitHub Actions)
# playwright.config.ts (for running tests locally)
# I created a GitHub Actions variable to specify the CI version of the config
# to run in the GitHub runner environment
