# ╔═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
# ║  We have two separate Playwright config files.              ║
# ║  Why? Running Playwright locally, I want the tests to       ║
# ║  run in headed mode and slowMo so I can watch them, but     ║
# ║  I don't want that in the CI env. And locally...            ║
# ║  I run one spec at a time and one test at a time so I can   ║
# ║  watch it playback, whereas in CI/CD the tests run in       ║
# ║  parallel for faster execution. Also I'm specifying retry   ║
# ║  attempts in the CI/CD config with no need to check the env ║
# ║  variable (process.env.CI) as I separate the two configs.   ║
# ║                                                             ║
# ║  If you explore the root of the test-playwright repo, you'll║
# ║  find two separate configuration files.                     ║
# ║  playwright.actions.config.ts (for GitHub Actions)          ║
# ║  playwright.config.ts (for running tests locally)           ║
# ║  I created a GitHub Actions variable to specify the CI      ║
# ║  version of the config to run in the GitHub runner          ║
# ║  environment.                                               ║

# Note:
# Tests are triggered on both push and pull_request events,
# which results in duplicate runs (for PRs).
#
# Since I push directly to 'main' for most updates (except Dependabot PRs),
# this setup works fine for me.
#
# I have GitGuardian configured both through YAML and as a GitHub App integration.
# This results in redundant checks, but I wanted to see how both approaches work.

# One time it appears a race condition occured when multiple Dependabot PRs were open and tried to push the Allure report to the main branch in the Allure repo.
# You may see this error:
# ! [remote rejected] main -> main (cannot lock ref 'refs/heads/main').
# - This doesn't slow things down because after merging a PR, Dependabot automatically rebases any other open Dependabot PRs and reruns the tests.
# - Once you merge in the first PR, just wait for the second PR to rebase as usual. If it doesn't, click the "Update Branch" button in the PR.
# - If it happens again I'll look into it further, but for now it doesn't seem to be a big issue.
