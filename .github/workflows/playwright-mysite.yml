# ║  We use three Playwright configs to keep local and CI       ║
# ║  environments separate. Locally, tests run headed and slow, ║
# ║  one at a time for easy watching. CI runs tests in parallel ║
# ║  with retries set and no need to check process.env.CI.      ║
# ║                                                             ║
# ║  This avoids mistakes from env mix-ups and simplifies setup.║
# ║                                                             ║
# ║  The configs are:                                           ║
# ║  - playwright.config.ts (local)                             ║
# ║  - playwright.actions.config.ts (GitHub Actions)            ║
# ║  - playwright.actions-db.config.ts (API tests)              ║
# ║                                                             ║
# ║  A GitHub Actions variable selects which CI config to use.  ║
# ╚═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

# Note:
# Tests are triggered on both push and pull_request events,
# which results in duplicate runs (for PRs).
#
# Since I push directly to 'main' for most updates (except Dependabot PRs),
# this setup works fine for me.
#
# I have GitGuardian configured both through YAML and as a GitHub App integration.
# This results in redundant checks, but I wanted to see how both approaches work.

# Race Conditions on Concurrent PRs
# If multiple pull requests are open and their workflows try to access the the branch
# the Allure reports live in, you might hit a race condition when one of the workflows
# tries to push the report back to that repo. `! [remote rejected] live-reports -> live-reports
# (cannot lock ref 'refs/heads/live-reports': is locked`
# In my case it's multiple Dependabot PRs all being opened at the same time that cause this,
# and it's not a big deal for me. I just merge whichever one passed clean, and the others
# sort themselves out by automatically rebasing and rerunning.
# UPDATE: I've since worked around this issue..
# by adding "continue-on-error: true" to the step that deploys the Allure report.
# Now if the report fails to deploy, the workflow doesn't fail.
# I can still see the HTML report in the workflow summary page anyways.
