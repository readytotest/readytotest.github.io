### Important Change: March 4th, 2025

- **Added pre-commit hook** with Husky and Lint Staged for staged file linting.
- Set up **ESLint** and **Prettier** to ensure code consistency and quality.
- Integrated **HTML linting** using `@html-eslint/eslint-plugin` to catch issues like duplicate IDs in HTML files.
- Configured linting to run on **JavaScript, JSX, HTML, CJS, and HTM** files.
- Enforced code formatting automatically with Prettier during commits.
- Improved development workflow by preventing bad commits with automated lint checks.

This setup ensures that all code adheres to a consistent style guide before being committed, preventing any potential issues in the codebase.

**Context:**  
I had been using a similar setup on the Playwright repo for a while, but had been lagging on getting it done for this repo. Itâ€™s kind of tedious and requires a lot of troubleshooting to work out all the kinks, but itâ€™s finally sorted out and working as expected. ðŸ˜…

**After cloning the repo, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run `npm install` to set up dependencies.**

You can start up the local server by typing node server.js in the VS Code terminal
<br>
or if you want to start it by the bash script you can type: chmod +x start-server.sh
<br>
and then ./start-server.sh (Note: Bash script isn't necessary, it was just something
<br>
I was tinkering with)

# The files for my GitHub pages website

! YAML files for GitHub Actions workflows,
! including playwright-mysite.yml, which checks
! out both this repo and the test-playwright repo
! and then runs tests against PRs and commits

- Cypress scripts, which I'm no longer maintaining
- except for readyToTestSmoke.cy.js, which runs in
- GH Actions cypress-mysite.yml to test my site
- on a cron schedule

+ I'm mostly focused on Playwright these days, so
+ check out my test-playwright repo to see what
+ I'm currently tinkering with
