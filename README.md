**This repo has a pre-commit hook that lints staged files using Husky, Lint Staged,
<br>
ESLint, Prettier, and HTML linting. If a commit fails, check the logs to see why.**
<br>
<br>
After cloning the repo, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run `npm install` to set up dependencies.
<br>
**This will attempt to overwrite the Husky pre-commit and .gitignore files! Be sure to undo those changes!**

You can start up the local server by typing node server.js in the VS Code terminal
<br>
or if you want to start it by the bash script you can type: chmod +x start-server.sh
<br>
and then ./start-server.sh (Note: Bash script isn't necessary, it was just something
<br>
I was tinkering with)

# The files for my GitHub pages website

! YAML files for GitHub Actions workflows,
! including playwright-mysite.yml, which checks
! out both this repo and the test-playwright repo
! and then runs tests against PRs and commits

- Cypress scripts, which I'm no longer maintaining
- except for readyToTestSmoke.cy.js, which runs in
- GH Actions cypress-mysite.yml to test my site
- on a cron schedule

+ I'm mostly focused on Playwright these days, so
+ check out my test-playwright repo to see what
+ I'm currently tinkering with

```
