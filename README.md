# üíª My GitHub Pages Site: QA, Automation & Tinkering

Welcome to the repo for my personal site. This is where I mess around with software QA, test automation, and web stuff.

## üîç What this repo's about

- This site lives on **GitHub Pages**
- GitHub Actions run tests on it using **Playwright**
- There's some **Cypress** code still hanging around
- Quality gates, linting, and experimenting

## üöÄ Quick Start

Clone the repo, then:

```
npm install
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Heads up: `npm install` might overwrite the .gitignore and pre-commit inside the .husky/\_ dir. Undo that if it happens.

### Local Dev Setup

If you want to run the tests locally with the dev server:

1. Run the server with:
   `node server.js`  
   Or with the bash script (not necessary, just for fun):  
   `chmod +x start-server.sh` (Only need to do this if permissions aren't set 1st time)  
   `./start-server.sh`

## üßº Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit is set up with Husky + lint-staged. Here's what runs on staged files:

- `eslint` and HTML linting/Cypress plugins for that
- `prettier` for formatting (Set this up as an eslint plugin also)

If your commit fails, check the logs.

# GitHub Pages site source files

! GitHub Actions YAMLs
! playwright-mysite.yml pulls in th test-playwright repo and runs tests on PRs/pushes

- Old Cypress scripts (mostly retired)
- One still active: readyToTestSmoke.cy.js (runs on a schedule via GH Actions)

+ Playwright is the main character now
+ If you're curious, check out my test-playwright repo

```

## üõ†Ô∏è Workspace Files

If you are using VS Code, I recommend you open the repo with **VS Code's workspace files**. The file is located in the root of the repo and has the `.code.workspace` extension. It contains configurations for the **Prettier** extension and **recommended extensions**.

If you want, you can add the paths to both this repo and the test-playwright repo in your workspace, which allows you to work on them simultaneously. However, I personally prefer working with one repo at a time to keep things organized, unless I'm wanting to test Playwright against my site locally.
